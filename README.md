# Marc's backlog, a.k.a. "Why is X not being worked on?"

## Background
Being a finite human being I have a limited amount of time available. Rather than pretend I can do it all, I have to recognize that I cannot. Likewise, my memory is finite so I need a place to put down my public TODO list.  Inspired by  [Pete Batard's backlog](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/wiki/Backlog) entry, I'm doing the same here.

Every so often (more times than I'd like to have to answer), I get asked about the state of feature X from one of my projects, and when it will become available. Because of this, I have decided to create a page that I can simply point to, to try to answer these questions and capture the list of things I would do if I had infinite time. Many of these things are coding related, so are not.

The first thing you should understand, and this is unfortunately true for most Open Source developers, is: as much as we would like, we cannot spend our entire days coding and adding features to our Open Source projects. Most of us also hold a 9 to 5 job, in companies that usually have little interest in fostering their employee's Open Source initiatives. And for some, the company may actually go as far as actively prohibiting access to sites like SourceForge or github from their network. :(

What this means for '''you''' is that, for the best part of the day, I do not have the possibility to engage in anything Open Source related and as a result the time I can spend working on the features highlighted below is very limited.

And so, without further ado, please find below the state of my current backlog, more or less in the order I plan to tackle it. Besides each task, you'll also find estimates of the time adding the feature is likely to take (for that task alone). But I must stress out that these estimate are always a best case scenario. Realistically, you want to at least double these times, and remember that they are not by any means the promise of an ETA.
